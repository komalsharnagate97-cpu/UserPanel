You are an expert React + Vite + Tailwind developer.  
I am attaching my existing project as a ZIP file.  

⚠️ First, check inside the ZIP what has already been built.  
⚠️ Then fix the current errors.  
⚠️ After that, complete the pending work.  
⚠️ Remember: this is ONLY the **User Panel**, not Admin Panel or Backend.

### Step 1: Fix Errors
- In the ZIP, `npm run dev` is failing because "dev" script is missing.  
- Add proper scripts in package.json:  
  "dev": "vite",  
  "build": "vite build",  
  "preview": "vite preview"  
- Ensure the project runs locally with `npm install` + `npm run dev`.

### Step 2: Complete Pending User Panel Features

**Auth Flow**
- Sign-up page with: Full Name, Mobile, Email, City, Country, Business Category, Password + Confirm.  
- Login page with Email + Password.  
- Form validation: required fields, confirm password match, invalid email format.  
- On submit → log data in console only (no backend).  

**Routing**
- Use React Router with routes: /login, /signup, /dashboard, /products, /referral, /notifications, /faq, /profile.  
- After login, redirect to /dashboard.  

**Dashboard Page**
- Greeting strip with user’s name.  
- Business snapshot (static sample numbers).  
- Motivational highlight.  
- Success stories carousel.  
- Mini performance snapshot.  
- Campaign teaser.  

**Sidebar Navigation**
- Links: Dashboard, Our Products, Referral Program, Connect With Us, Notifications, FAQ, Profile, Logout.  
- Sidebar collapsible on mobile.  
- Topbar sticky.  

**Our Products Page**
- Left panel: List of products (WhatsApp Automation, Wasender, Ready + Grow, Map Extractor, Digital Visiting Card, Bulk IVR Calls, Website Service).  
- Right panel: blank placeholder.  
- Each product stored as modular folder in `/products/product-name/`:  
  - config.json  
  - demo.js  
  - buy.js  
  - ai.js (optional toggle)  
  - style.css  
  - assets/ (videos, icons)  

**Referral Program Page**
- Show 3-level referral chain (static demo data).  
- Invite/share button (log action in console).  
- Wallet/earnings panel with Withdraw button (mock only, no integration).  

**Other Pages**
- Connect With Us → pre-filled WhatsApp/email links.  
- Notifications → static list + toggle.  
- FAQ → accordion style.

### Step 3: UI/UX
- Dark Mode Theme:  
  Background: #212121, #121212  
  Primary: #1E88E5  
  Hover: #F9A825  
  Success: #00C853  
  Error: #D32F2F  
- Responsive desktop + mobile.  
- Modals center aligned.  
- Touch-friendly.

### Rules
- NO Stripe, Razorpay, Binance, or external payments. Only placeholders.  
- NO dummy/test users. Use configs and static placeholders only.  
- Must remain modular → editing one product/module must not break others.  
- At the end, deliver a **corrected and complete ZIP** ready to run locally.  
- Do NOT deploy, do NOT ask for API keys or secrets. I only need the code.
