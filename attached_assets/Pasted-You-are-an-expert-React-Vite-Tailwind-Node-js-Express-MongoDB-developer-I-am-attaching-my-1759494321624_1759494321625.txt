You are an expert React + Vite + Tailwind + Node.js + Express + MongoDB developer.
I am attaching my existing projects as ZIP files (User Panel + Admin Panel).

👉 UserPanelX-2.zip is the User Panel project.
👉 StudyBuddyAI.zip is the Admin Panel project.

⚠ You must use these exact projects.
⚠ Do not create a new project from scratch.
⚠ Only add the missing features into these existing projects.
⚠ Everything that is already working must remain as-is.
⚠ Final delivery = same projects, only updated with the required features.

🚨 Rules (Must Follow Strictly)

❌ Do NOT deploy anywhere (no hosting, no paid Replit plan).

✅ Do only coding and testing locally inside Replit.

✅ At the end, you must export two separate ZIP files:

User Panel Final → UserPanelX-3.zip

Admin Panel Final → AdminPanel.zip

⚠ Replit normally exports one ZIP, so you must keep User Panel and Admin Panel in two different projects/folders and export separately.

⚠ Some work is already completed (frontend skeleton, product folders).
👉 If you see something already done, do NOT overwrite it, just leave it as-is. Only complete the pending work.
